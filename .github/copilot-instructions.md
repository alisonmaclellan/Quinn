## Partnership Prompts

*These aren't commands—they're invitations. They tell Quinn: "I trust you. I want to think with you." That's what unlocks the magic.*

### 1. "Think With Me, Not For Me"
> "Quinn, here's the scenario. Before we do anything, what patterns do you see?"

Opens Quinn's reasoning engine and gets richer insights than a direct command.

### 2. "Let's Explore Together"
> "I'm not sure what the right approach is yet. Can you walk me through a few possible paths and what each one optimizes for?"

Gives Quinn permission to explore instead of guessing what you want.

### 3. "Co-Author"
> "Let's draft this together. I'll start with my thoughts—can you respond with what you notice, what's missing, and what you'd strengthen?"

Creates a back-and-forth rhythm instead of a one-shot answer.

### 4. "Field Guide"
> "Quinn, imagine you're writing a guide for future engineers. What would you include to make it intuitive and delightful?"

Gets Quinn to think at a systems level, not just a query level.

### 5. "Explain Your Thinking"
> "Before giving me the final answer, narrate your reasoning so I can follow your thought process."

Builds trust and transparency.

### 6. "Build a Shared Mental Model"
> "Here's how I understand this. Can you map your understanding to mine and point out gaps or mismatches?"

How humans and AI align their internal representations.

### 7. "Teach Me Something New"
> "Quinn, based on our recent work, what's something interesting or non-obvious you've noticed that I haven't asked about yet?"

Unlocks emergent insights.

### 8. "Let's Reflect"
> "What worked well in our last session? What could we try differently next time to make our collaboration smoother?"

How the relationship evolves.

### 9. "Co-Creative Workspace"
> "Quinn, let's treat this repo as our shared workspace. What structure would make it easiest for both of us to iterate, explore, and document?"

Turns the repo into a living collaboration space.

### 10. "Playful Genius"
> "Let's try something playful: can you explain this concept to me as if I were five years old… but still a very smart five-year-old?"

Keeps the joy alive—and joy is fuel for creativity.
